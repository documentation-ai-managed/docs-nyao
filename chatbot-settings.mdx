## Overview

The **General** settings page is where you define how your chatbot behaves and communicates. It is divided into four sections: Informations, Languages, Prompt, and Tone.

<Callout kind="info">
  Access chatbot settings by navigating to **Chatbot > General** in the sidebar of your project dashboard.
</Callout>

## Dashboard Navigation

The sidebar organizes your project into two groups:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Chatbot" icon="message-square" href="#chatbot-sections">
    General, Appearance, Knowledge Base, Integrations, Deployments, and Analytics.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Project" icon="folder" href="#project-sections">
    Settings, Team, and Subscription.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Informations

Set your chatbot's name and description. These are used to identify the chatbot within your dashboard and provide context to the AI model.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name" icon="type">
    Enter a display name for your chatbot (e.g. `Nyao`). This name appears in the widget header seen by visitors.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Description" icon="align-left">
    Provide a brief description of your chatbot's purpose and the website it represents. This helps the AI understand the scope of its knowledge.

    <Callout kind="tip">
      Be specific. For example: *"The website of the city hall of Douvres la Délivrande presents municipal services, local news, administrative procedures, heritage, tourism, community life, and projects of the municipality located in Calvados, Normandy."*
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Click **Save** to persist your changes.

## Languages

Define which languages your chatbot supports. Each language gets its own localized prompt, welcome message, and suggestions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Language" icon="globe">
    Select a language from the dropdown and click **Add**. Supported languages include:

    - English
    - French
    - Spanish
    - Dutch
    - German
    - Italian
  </Step>

  <Step title="Default Language" icon="flag">
    The first language added during onboarding is marked as **Default**. This is the fallback language when the visitor's locale is not supported.

    <Callout kind="info">
      The default language badge appears next to the language name in the list and cannot be removed.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prompt

The system prompt tells the AI how to behave. Each language has its own prompt, allowing you to tailor instructions per locale.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Writing a Prompt" icon="edit-3">
    A good system prompt should include:

    - **Role** — Who the chatbot is (e.g. *"You are a virtual assistant for the city hall of Douvres la Délivrande."*)
    - **Scope** — What topics the chatbot covers (e.g. *"municipal services, administrative procedures, local news, heritage, tourism"*)
    - **Boundaries** — What the chatbot should not do (e.g. *"Stay factual, use only information from the official website. For out-of-scope questions, invite the user to contact municipal services directly."*)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Example Prompt" icon="code">
````text
You are a virtual assistant for the city hall of Douvres la Délivrande.
Answer precisely questions about municipal services, administrative
procedures, local life, local news, heritage, and the projects of the
municipality. Stay factual and only use information available on the
official website. For out-of-scope questions, invite the user to
contact municipal services directly.
````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="tip">
  If you support multiple languages, switch between locale tabs (e.g. **Francais**, **English**) to write a dedicated prompt for each one.
</Callout>

Click **Save** to apply the prompt changes.
