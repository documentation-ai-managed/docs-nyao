## Create Your First Chatbot Project

Set up your AI-powered chatbot in a few steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fill the Onboard Form" icon="cpu">
    From the onboarding page, provide the following details:

    - **Website URL** — The website Nyao will crawl to build your chatbot's knowledge base
    - **Language** — The primary language for your chatbot (English, French, Spanish, Dutch, German, or Italian)
    - **Plan** — Choose a subscription plan (Starter, Pro, or Enterprise)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Payment" icon="credit-card">
    You'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout. Complete your payment to activate the automated setup.

    <Callout kind="info">
      Your subscription includes monthly message credits, automatic web crawling, and more depending on your plan.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch the Magic Happen" icon="sparkles">
    After payment, Nyao automatically:

    1. **Crawls your website** — Extracts content from your pages
    2. **Processes knowledge** — Uses AI to understand your content, generate a chatbot prompt, welcome message, and suggested questions
    3. **Styles your chatbot** — Detects your logo, brand colors, and applies them to the widget

    A real-time stepper shows progress for each phase. Once complete, you'll see a success screen with confetti!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Embed the Chatbot on Your Website

Deploy your chatbot widget with a single script tag.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Script Tag" icon="code">
    Add the following snippet before the closing `</body>` tag of your website:

````html
<script src="https://nyao.bmarguerite.fr/widget/embed.js?chatbotId=YOUR_CHATBOT_ID&locale=fr"></script>
````

    Replace `YOUR_CHATBOT_ID` with the ID found in your project dashboard.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="iframe" icon="layout">
    Alternatively, embed the chatbot directly as an iframe:

````html
<iframe
  src="https://nyao.bmarguerite.fr/widget/YOUR_CHATBOT_ID"
  style="position:fixed;bottom:80px;right:20px;width:400px;height:600px;border:none;border-radius:20px;z-index:9999;"
></iframe>
````
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Once embedded, a chat button appears in the bottom-right corner of your site. Visitors click it to open the chatbot widget.
