## Document Organization and Structuring

Organize your documentation into logical structures using folders and pages. You create nested hierarchies to group related content, making it intuitive for readers to navigate.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to your space root and click the new folder button. Name it descriptively, like `API Reference`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Pages" icon="file-plus">
    Inside a folder, create new pages. Use the drag-and-drop interface to reorder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Permissions" icon="lock">
    Configure access levels for folders to control who can view or edit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This approach keeps large projects manageable. For example, structure as `Getting Started` > `Installation` > platform-specific guides.

## Collaboration and Real-Time Editing

Invite team members to collaborate instantly. Multiple users edit the same page simultaneously, with changes appearing live.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Invite Collaborators" icon="user-plus">
    Go to space settings, enter email addresses, and assign roles like Editor or Viewer.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Live Editing" icon="edit-3">
    Open a page and see cursors from other users. Use `@mentions` to notify teammates.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Comments" icon="message-circle">
    Add inline comments for feedback without altering the main content.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Version History and Revisions

Nyao automatically saves every edit, providing a complete audit trail. You review changes, compare versions, and revert if needed.

<Expandable title="Advanced Version Management" default-open="false">

  Access history via the page menu. Each revision shows the author, timestamp, and diff highlights.

  ```javascript
  // Example: Programmatic access via Nyao API (if integrated)
  const revisions = await nyao.pages.getRevisions('doc-id');
  console.log(revisions[0].changes); // Latest changes
  ```

  Restore by selecting a version and clicking `Revert`.

## Search, Tagging, and Filtering Tools

Find exactly what you need with full-text search across your entire space. Add tags to pages for categorization, then filter results dynamically.

| Feature       | Description                          | Example Usage                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Global Search | Searches titles, content, and tags   | Type `API authentication`     |
| Tags          | Custom labels like `v1.0`, `internal`| Filter by multiple tags       |
| Filters       | By date, author, or folder           | Recent changes by `@teamlead` |

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Enter Query] --> B[Search Index]
    B --> C[Match Titles & Content]
    B --> D[Scan Tags]
    C --> E[Results]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Apply Filters]
    F --> G[Display]
```

Use tags like `#feature` or `#bugfix` to organize changelogs effectively.
